## What is GpProfile?

GpProfile is a utility that allows Delphi developers to check the performance of their applications, find bottlenecks and remove them. In short, it is a profiler.

GpProfile will help you speed up your Delphi programs. 

The package contains of an executable and an include dir. The executable is a program to configure the code to be measured (instrument it). The include is used by the code to be instrumented. It supports Delphi version from version 2 up to the latest version. 

## User interface

GpProfile is divided into two parts - Instrumentation and Analysis. The user interface follows this division. The main part of GpProfile's form can be switched into instrumentation or analysis mode; there are tabs with the corresponding toolbars.

There are only two common functions - Preferences and Layout Manager, both accessible through the GpProfile menu.
